# Week 37 - 14 September

## Last week's debrief

### Tech :computer:

* [@aeddi] bumped react-native 0.61.5 -> 0.63.2: https://github.com/berty/berty/pull/2280
* [@aeddi] set up Crashlytics + Shakebugs with clean env system: https://github.com/berty/berty/pull/2223
  1. Crashlytics if not optional, the user can't disable it
  2. I mentioned everywhere in comments that it was temporary, only for the closed beta
  3. On Buildkite, there is a problem with the Android build agent: we can't pass secrets to the docker plugin env, as a workaround I get the secrets directly from a file, which is not as secure
  4. To enable Shakebugs when you build locally, you have to put the content of the 1Password entry `Shakebugs Secret` in the file `js/.env`
