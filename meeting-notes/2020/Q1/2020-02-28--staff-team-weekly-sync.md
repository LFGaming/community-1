* [@gfanton] worked all week on the RendezVous service (a.k.a Tinder package ðŸ”¥) (https://github.com/berty/berty/pull/1673)
  * created an internal tinder pkg used for discovery
  * Added a cmd rdvp to start rendezvous point server
  * Implemented the rendezvous point driver
  * Implemented the mocked driver
  * Implemented the MultiDriver (used to manage multiple driver)
  * Implemented the Tinder service 
* [@D4ryl00] continued BLE driver implementation.
  * Device scanner and advertising are ok
  * GATT connection, find Berty service and read service characteristics (aka remote PeerID)
  * Feedback that a remote device has been found to the main core BLE driver for the HandlePeerFound interface implementation
  * Thread implementation, stability and optimization: can start multiple device connections at the same time
* [@glouvigny] https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db/pull/33 finished removing the callbacks in the event system, replaced them with channels, I need to investigate what codecov is complaining about, still awaiting review 
* [@glouvigny] https://github.com/berty/berty/pull/1639 "message store and chain key implementation" PR, need rebase
* [@glouvigny] simplified the code in `orbitutil`, I'm currently happy with the architecture, I don't know if I need to open another PR or keep on the current one. Branch is on https://github.com/glouvigny/berty/tree/glouvigny/message_store_refact
* [@glouvigny] attempted to add persistence in `berty mini` client. When enabled, it hangs on macOS, works on Linux but it is painfully slow. We can reopen previously received messages, keep our identity, keep the OrbitDB datastores. Same branch as above.
