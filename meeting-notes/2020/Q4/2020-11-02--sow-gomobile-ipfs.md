# SOW Update - Gomobile IPFS - 02 Nov

This is our third follow-up report regarding the gomobile-ipfs SOW. 

We will start migrating the Berty's codebase to gomobile-ipfs during the next week.

If things go well, it will be finished quickly and we will use gomobile-ipfs on a daily basis; we will then follow the roadmap defined in [Report #1](https://github.com/berty/community/blob/master/meeting-notes/2020/Q4/2020-10-20--sow-gomobile-ipfs.md).

If things go wrong, we will write an issue explaining the process to serve as documentation for people having related integration issues. And update the roadmap at the end of the integration process.
