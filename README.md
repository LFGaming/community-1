## About

Welcome to the Berty Project, we are an NGO that defends privacy and fights against censorship and surveillance.
If these topics speak to you and your values correspond to ours, we would very much like you to join our community.

At Berty, we have a true emphasis on our community. You are the driving force behind the project. We are more than ever grateful for the investment of time and effort you have made and will make.

Please never underestimate your contribution. Little + Little = Big. We do believe in the butterfly effect. Help us to fight censorship and mass surveillance because everyone’s privacy matters.

Here you will find a comprehensive list of all needed information about the community and a bunch of ideas.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

The Berty team.
